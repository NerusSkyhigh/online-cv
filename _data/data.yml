    summary: |
      <div style="text-align: justify">
      I’m a recently graduated Physicist (Master’s degree) at Trento with a strong passion for computer science. This passion led me to choose a computational path both for my curricular and extracurricular classes. I’m one of the founding members of Progetto Apollo, a scientific divulgation group operating at the University of Trento in collaboration with Arditodesìo. Since 2019 I’ve been a tutor for the University of Trento. My hobbies include video games and parkour.

    - role: Storyteller
      time: 2017 - Oct 2022
      company: Arditodesìo / University of Trento
      details: |
        I'm one of the founding members of Progetto Apollo, a scientific divulgation group operating at the University of Trento in collaboration with Arditodesìo. Some of our activities include research on a key topic or an interview with a Professor at the University of Trento to write narratives with the principles of storytelling. The narratives were then performed in the course of various editions of *Teatro della Meraviglia*, *EIT RAW Materials 2021*, *CO.SCIENZA Festival 2019*, *Focus Days 2019* and *Fisicittà 2017*. In 2022 we partnered with *Caltech* to write four narratives presented both in Trento and at *Caltech*.

    assignments:
      - title: Percolation - Theory and Applications
        link: "https://github.com/NerusSkyhigh/multiscale-percolation"
        tagline: "For the course "Multi-Scale Methods in Soft Matter Physics" I wrote a review that introduces the reader to the Bernoulli percolation model and its phase transition. The review also presents attempts to apply Bernoulli percolation to physical problems and a proof of concept for simulation based on the Monte-Carlo method."

      - title: Machine Learning Phases of Matter
        link: "https://github.com/NerusSkyhigh/Machine-Learning-Phases-of-Matter"
        tagline: "This project aims to reobtain the results presented in "Machine learning phases of matter" (Juan Carrasquilla, Roger G. Melko) regarding the two-dimensional square Ising model. The authors show that a standard feed-forward neural network (FFNN) is a suitable tool to detect Ising's model phase transition."

      - title: A Game of Life
        link: "https://github.com/NerusSkyhigh/LoAE-code"
        tagline: "Developed for the course "Laboratory of Advanced Electronics" including my final project that implements Conway's Game of Life on an FPGA and outputs the results using the VGA standard."
