    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Hi, I'm a recently graduated Physicist (Master's degree) at Trento with a strong passion for computer science. This passion led me to choose a computational path both for my curricular classes (e.g. _Computational Physics_ (ay. 2021),  _Quantum computing_ (ay. 2021), _Intelligent optimization and machine learning_ (ay. 2019) ) and extracurricular (I took part in the 2021 edition of the _Cyberchallenge_; _Data Mining for Physicists_ (aa 2020) ). I'm one of the founding members of _Progetto Apollo_, a scientific divulgation group operating at the University of Trento in collaboration with Arditodesìo. My hobbies include skill-based videogames and parkour. Since 2019 I've been a tutor for the University of Trento (2019-2020 Calculus, 2021-today Laboratory of Physics).

        I'm one of the founding members of Progetto Apollo, a scientific divulgation group operating at the University of Trento in collaboration with Arditodesìo. Some of our activities include research on a key topic or an interview with a Professor at UniTN in order to write narratives with the principles of storytelling. The narratives were then performed in the course of various editions of "Teatro della Meraviglia", EIT RAW Materials 2021,  "CO.SCIENZA Festival 2019", "Focus Days 2019" and "Fisicittà 2017".
